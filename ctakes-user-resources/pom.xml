	<description>For external projects to utilize user resources, e.g. piper files and bsv definitions.</description>
<!--	This is not a normal module.  There should not be code or resources in this module.  -->
<!--	This module, in conjunction with the main ctakes pom, creates a ctakes-user-resources jar that can be -->
<!--	a dependency for other projects.  -->
<!--	Follow me here ...  -->
<!--	1.  We want to place user resources ( pipers, regex bsvs, stop words, etc.) in separate modules.  -->
<!--	2.  For editable 'runtime' dev flexibility we want said resources in the resources/ directory upon compile. -->
<!--	3.  We want user resources to be available in binary installations under a common resources/ directory.  -->
<!--	4.  Given #2 and #3 above, we do not want multiple copies of user resources in jars and resources/ dirs.  -->
<!--	5.  There are external projects that depend upon user resources, so they must be available for 'getting'.  -->
<!--	Note: External projects include Apache cTAKES projects such as ctakes-web-rest.  -->
